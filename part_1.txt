Part 1: Discussion Questions

Recursion

In your own words, what is recursion?

Recursion is when a function calls itself, and has a base case that fulfills some kind of requirement. It's an elegant way of articulating an iteration. (Not always, sometimes a good old loop just makes more sense.)

Why is it necessary to have a base case?

So that the recursive function can fulfill a requirement. Otherwise it will go on forever!

Graphs

What is a graph?

A graph is a tree-like data structure that contains loops, or cycles. The relationships between nodes can be directed or non-directed. Basic units are nodes, which are connected by edges. These edges can have a weight attached to them.

How is a graph different from a tree?

Trees do not have loops.

Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.

Find shortest distance between point A and point B on a map.

function upToTen(num) {
    var num = num || 0;

    if (num === 10) {
        return "at ten";
    } else {
        num += 1;
        upToTen(num);
    }
}
